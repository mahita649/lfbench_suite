## this is for MAD-MCAS; all the flags and libary we were using looks
like works for aarch-64 or something so changed the gnu-compile for
arm tot he generic old one with armv6 or something. 

---see the Makefile to compile hence!


Becuase there is no 128-bit CAS in ARM arch, we cannot compile for
aarch-64 for a DCAS-using single CAS on ARM machines; instead we do
for 32-bit ARM arch such that we use a 64-bit CAS for a DCAS on the
    union!!
